Refactor after STEP 1: Added stack array held in an int[], int to act as top stack ptr, IsEmpty() method.
Refactor after STEP 2: Added push() method to add numbers into int array.
Refactor after STEP 3: Added pop() method to remove numbers off the 'top' of the stack.
Refactor after STEP 4: Changed pop() to return an int (number off top of stack) instead of void.
Refactor after STEP 5: No structural changes.
Refactor after STEP 6: Added if statement (error checking) in the pop() method to check if stack is empty.
Refactor after STEP 7: Added top() method that prints value at 'top' of the stack.
Refactor after STEP 8: Made top() method return the value at the 'top' of the stack (int).
Refactor after STEP 9: Added if statement (error checking) in top() method to check if stack is empty.
                       Changed error messages to return -9863 instead of -1 in the top() & pop() methods
                       (random negative number is less likely to be added to the stack then -1).
Refactor after STEP 10: Made an if statement (error checking) in push() method to check if stack is full.
                        Would normally throw an exception if full stack is pushed, instead promts error
                        message and returns.
Refactor after STEP 11: No structural changes, added documentation and comments.
